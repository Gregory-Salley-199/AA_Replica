# AA_Replica
 Replica AA Game
 
 Game is followed by the Brackey's Tutorial.
 Errors occured in Unity with the build view not zooming back out. 
 Altered to have an intro, game, and ending scene. 
 Intro and Ending scene have buttons to play, play agian or close the game. 
 
 Errors occured in placing the Score Directly over the rotator. 
 
 Rotator and Pin are the simple Knob prefab as, my own premade one was causing functionality errors. 
 Scripts are placed into a Scripts folder, Scenes in a Scene Folder, all items for Game scene in a Gamescene folder. 
 
 Still occasional run time errors, needs colliders zeroed in better to their fabs.
